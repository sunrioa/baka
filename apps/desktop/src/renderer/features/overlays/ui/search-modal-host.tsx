 * The Search modal, wired to the overlays: open state and the thread search
 * come from the controller, and only the navigation into a Session stays a
 * shell action. Astryx restores the opener for ordinary closes.
 *
 * `deps` keeps one identity for the life of the controller. The modal's
 * debounce effect lists `searchRecall` in its dependencies, and a fresh
 * identity per render tore the timer down before it fired while a turn was
 * streaming, which made search dead exactly then.
