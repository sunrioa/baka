/**
 * PR-SHOW-AFTER-FIRST-COMMIT: shared reveal gate for the hidden main window.
 *
 * The BrowserWindow is created with `show: false` (main-window.ts); the
 * `ready-to-show` event reveals it on the first painted frame, which is the
 * index.html launch surface by design. Two further callers exist as
 * backstops: the `window:notifyRendererReady` IPC (fired after the
 * renderer's first React commit paints) and a fallback timer for a wedged
 * renderer. Both route through here so the show() decision lives in one
 * place — and so it stays unit-testable without an Electron runtime
 * (main-window.ts itself can't be imported under plain `node --test`
 * because it pulls in `electron`).
 */

/**
 * How far this run is allowed to go when it reveals the main window.
 *
 *  - `hidden`: never reveal. E2E-fixture captures paint the hidden window via
 *    `paintWhenInitiallyHidden`, so pixels arrive without a window on screen.
 *  - `inactive`: reveal, never raise. An E2E run that asked for a visible
 *    window (`MAKA_E2E_SHOW_WINDOW`) needs the compositor and a real layout —
 *    a hidden window is throttled to ~1fps under xvfb and geometry assertions
 *    need one — but taking the foreground from the developer running the suite
 *    is never part of that.
 *  - `active`: the product. Reveal and honor foreground intent.
 */

/**
 * The run's reveal mode. `showWindowRequested` (MAKA_E2E_SHOW_WINDOW) asks for
 * a visible window; it does not ask for focus, so it can only lift `hidden` to
 * `inactive`. Only a run that is not an E2E run at all is `active`.
 *
 * A packaged build ignores a stray E2E flag entirely. That rule lives here
 * rather than in one consumer, because both of them — the reveal gate and the
 * dock rule — have to read the same answer; a build whose window may take
 * focus while the dock treats it as an accessory app is neither mode.

 * Readiness-aware wrapper around showWindowOnceReady. Focus requests that
 * arrive before the window has painted (user re-launches or clicks the
 * dock icon while the window is still hidden) must NOT show() the window —
 * that would flash an unpainted frame the hidden creation exists to
 * suppress. They are remembered and flushed as show()+focus() when markReady
 * fires, so the user's foreground intent is honored, just not early.
 *
 * The same deferral applies to restoring a saved maximized state: Electron's
 * BrowserWindow.maximize() reveals a still-hidden window (verified on macOS),
 * so createWindow must not call it directly — requestMaximize holds the
 * intent and markReady applies it right before the reveal. In `active` mode
 * that means the window's first on-screen frame is already maximized. An
 * `inactive` window cannot have both: the reveal that maximize() performs is
 * an activating one, so it is revealed inactively first and then maximized,
 * and the zoom is visible. Not taking the foreground is worth more than the
 * single frame, and an E2E run has no saved maximized bounds to restore.
 *
 * `hidden` windows (e2e-fixture capture / E2E) never show, maximize, or take
 * focus from any path — captures run while the developer works elsewhere.
 * `inactive` windows appear but stay behind: a focus request reveals them and
 * stops there, so an E2E run's own activate / second-instance traffic cannot
 * pull the app in front of whatever the developer is doing.
