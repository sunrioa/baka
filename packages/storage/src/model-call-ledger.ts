/**
 * Materialization of the canonical model-call accounting ledger (#1679).
 *
 * The single durable authority is the AgentRun event stream: an attempt is
 * committed there as `model_call_attempt_recorded` before anything reaches this
 * table. Everything here is a projection of that stream, never an independent
 * write, and the upsert key is `attemptId` so re-projecting is idempotent.
 *
 * The table exists because the AgentRun store answers "what happened in this
 * run" and no Usage question is shaped that way. It may fall behind the stream
 * — a failed upsert, a crash between the two — and that is recoverable: the
 * authority still holds every record, so re-projecting the run restores it.
 *
 * That recovery covers live Sessions only. Deleting a Session drops its
 * `core_agent_runs` rows and cascades both their events and this projection's
 * checkpoints, while these rows are deliberately left standing — spend does not
 * disappear from all-time totals because a conversation was deleted. For those
 * rows the projection is the last copy, so nothing may rebuild this table by
 * clearing it and replaying the stream. See
 * `ConversationOperationalStateStore.purge`.
 *
 * A row holds one column per field a cost answer reads, and nothing else.
 * Request shape and provider diagnostics are answered from the AgentRun stream;
 * copied here they would make a row grow with the conversation rather than with
 * spend. Because they are columns, a Usage total is a `SUM` this table computes
 * — the reads below return answers, not records, so asking for an all-time
 * total no longer means handing every call a workspace ever made to the caller.
 *
 * Recovery compares the AgentRun stream's durable sequence with this
 * projection's applied-through checkpoint. There is no second "dirty" fact to
 * race with the authority: any committed event beyond the checkpoint remains
 * discoverable until it has been projected in the same transaction that
 * advances the checkpoint.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from `usage_llm_calls`. That table is a frozen
 * historical projection with no way to express `usageBasis` or `costBasis`, so
 * writing canonical records into it would land unpriced spend as `costUsd: 0` —
 * the failure this ledger exists to remove.
