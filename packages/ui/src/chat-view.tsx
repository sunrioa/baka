/**
 * How far outside the viewport, in pixels, rows are mounted.

 * virtua only corrects `scrollTop` for a row whose measurement lands while the
 * row is entirely above the viewport; a row still straddling the top edge is
 * left to push the reader. virtua's default is 200px and a wheel notch travels
 * 600, so a row went from unmounted to straddling within one notch and was
 * always measured too late: reading upwards through the 24-Turn geometry scene
 * jumped 13 times, by 5 to 194px.
 *
 * 2000px fixed the tall-Turn cases it was measured against but not the tallest
 * ones: a Turn whose real height exceeds the margin still reaches the reader
 * unmeasured, and the correction that lands then is the one virtua does not
 * absorb. On the 24-Turn geometry scene that row is ~3000px, so the cold sweep
 * slipped twice, displacing the reading anchor by 365px — and the gate caught it
 * in most runs, not rarely.
 *
 * The value is bounded on BOTH sides, which is why it is 4000 and not "as large
 * as possible". Under the tallest Turn, the gate fails as described. Far above
 * it — 6000 made the first upward reader step mount enough rows at once to move
 * the anchor by a full step (`per-step drift: -200` in
 * `upward-traversal-holds-turn-geometry`, a story that walks the transcript in
 * 200px reader steps). 4000 leaves the tall Turn measured before the reader
 * arrives while the first step still mounts a viewport's worth of rows, not a
 * page: the gate now slips at most once and displaces the anchor by ≤25px, and
 * the traversal story stays within its 1px budget.
 *
 * Mounting further ahead costs layout but not responsiveness: the gate's own
 * `layoutMs` reads 27–33ms here, no higher than at 2000px.
